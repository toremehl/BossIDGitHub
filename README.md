# BossIDWS.Vendor

* Full sample implementation in Visual Studio 2017 of the methods required by BIR BossID
* REST based API (WebApi 2.0)
* The project contains a sample APIKey – a unique key needs to be provided to BIR by vendor before integration testing
* Complete test project - can be used for unit testing and later on for integration tests
* Request and responseobjects defined - making it easier to validate input and return proper values to BossID
* Additional documentation is found in the main Bossid Vendor Requirements document: http://www.bir.no/losninger/Documents/BossID%20Vendor%20Requirements.pdf  

Sync the projects locally and F5 on the  “BossIDWS.Vendor.REST” project and the project should run. Hopefully pretty much self-documenting using the API link provided on the startup page - if not let us know! :-)
